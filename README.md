# Autonomous-Maze-Solving-Turtlebot3-Simulation
Autonomous Maze Solving TurtleBot3 using ROS2 and Gazebo. The robot explores unknown environments using frontier-based exploration, plans optimal paths with Dijkstra’s algorithm, and avoids obstacles in real-time using the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA).
# Autonomous Maze Solving Turtlebot3 Simulation

This repository contains the code to produce a **Gazebo Classic Simulation** of a **Turtlebot3** (***waffle***) robot (designed by *Robotis*) that navigates its way through a simple maze **autonomously**.

This repository was built while following the learnings and instructions of the **Udemy** Course **ROS2 Autonomous Driving and SLAM using NAV2 with TurtleBot3** created by **Muhammad Luqman**.

The software tools mainly used in building this project are :

- Python3 Interpreter
- Basic ROS2 Framework
- Gazebo Classic Simulator
- *turtlebot3_gazebo* ROS2 package
- *slam_toolbox* ROS2 package
- Navigation2 Stack

Operating System :
- Ubuntu (*you can use the latest version available*) 

In order to deploy this project successfully, all the above listed softwares must be installed in your Ubuntu OS.


## What is DIFFERENT in this Project ? 

Originally, this project was built as an **ament_python** type ROS2 package in the above mentioned Course. In this repository, it is built as an **ament_cmake** type ROS2 package and upgraded with frontier exploration, SLAM, and Nav2 autonomy.


## Deployment

To deploy this project, please follow the below mentioned steps.

- **Create a new folder** at a suitable space in your Ubuntu OS. You can name the folder anything you want. But for the sake of this demonstration, I am naming it as **Cloned Repo**

- Open a **new terminal** inside the folder.

- **Clone this repository** inside the folder by running the following terminal command.

    ```bash
    https://github.com/samuugithub/Autonomous-Maze-Solving-Turtlebot3-Simulation.git
    ```

- This will create a new folder named **Autonomous-Maze-Solving-Turtlebot3-Simulation** inside the **Cloned Repo** directory.

- Go inside the **Autonomous-Maze-Solving-Turtlebot3-Simulation** folder through the previously opened terminal.

    ```
    cd Autonomous-Maze-Solving-Turtlebot3-Simulation/
    ```

- Next, we need to build this project. So run the following command from the same terminal.

    ```bash
    colcon build
    ```
    
    This will generate 3 (three) new folders inside the **Autonomous Maze Solving Turtlebot3 Simulation** folder namely - **build**, **install** and **log**.

- Close the previous terminal.

- Next, finally we can deploy the project.
    
    - Open a new terminal inside the **Autonomous Maze Solving Turtlebot3 Simulation** directory and run the following commands:
        ```bash
        source install/setup.bash
        ros2 launch autonomous_tb3 super_launch.py
        ```

        This will open a **Gazebo Classic Simulator Window** with the upgraded academic maze world, plus a **RViz2 Window** that shows the live SLAM map and navigation path.
        
        Use ***Mouse Scroll Wheel*** to ***Zoom IN/Zoom OUT*** in both the **Gazebo** and **RViz2** enviroments.

        Use **left mouse button** (to PAN) and ***Mouse Scroll Button*** (to ROTATE) -- for adjusting the position and view of the **maze world** in the **Gazebo** environment - as per your convenience.

        Use **left mouse button** (to ROTATE) and ***Mouse Scroll Button*** (to PAN) -- for adjusting the position and view of the **2D maze map** in the **RViz2** environment - a per your convenience.

        Also, before proceeding to the next step, it is recomended to keep both the **Gazebo** and **Rviz2** windows opened side by side, so that you that you can see see what's happening in both the windows at the same time.

        The autonomous frontier explorer now starts from the same launch file, so no second terminal is required for the default workflow.

        If you want to run the explorer standalone for debugging, use:
        ```bash
        source install/setup.bash
        ros2 run autonomous_tb3 frontier_explorer.py
        ```


## Output

Once you have followed all the mentioned steps inside the **Deployment** section, the following **simulation output** can be seen in the **Gazebo Classic Simulator** window.

<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" poster="Thumbnail.png">
    <source src="Gazebo_Sim_Recording.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</figure>

You can also see the robot following ***the same*** trajectory in the ***2D maze map*** of the **RViz2** environment simultaneously. I could not screen record the **RViz2** simulation to show you - due to my computer hardware limitations.
